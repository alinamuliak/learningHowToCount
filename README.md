# Learn2Count
A Python program to help students learn how to count combinatorial tasks by practice.
The program has different problem sets based on Permutation, Allocations, Combinations and Basic Principle of Counting.
First, you see the problem on the screen, and you are asked to decide, which part of the Combinatorics (aka formula) you should use.
If you are correct, you can enter the numerical answer and the program will check if you're right.

These problem sets help to learn the common solutions for combinatorical tasks.
